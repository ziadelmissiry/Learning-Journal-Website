	<p>When it’s appropriate, ask your boss if you can make an announcement to all your colleagues  in an online meeting. Ask your colleagues how they'd like to be contacted, WhatsApp is always a good suggestion. It’s better to have an informal group chat so you and your colleagues can bond and help each other. Organize socials between you and your colleagues on the group chat, maybe even create a discord so you can all game together. However, you have to respect your colleagues and avoid vulgar or inappropriate comments on the group chat or you might get reported to HR. </p>

	<p>Some people believe that web development is a gift. However, it’s not a skill you can learn just like driving. In other words, you don’t have to be an artist or gifted to make a website look nice, there are certain rules you have to follow. Now that that’s out of the way, how do you get started? First, you have to decide whether you want to be a back-end or a front end developer or both. </p>
	<p>Front-end developers are the ones that design everything you see on the website and focus on the user interface, also known as UI. Front- end developers usually use these languages: <ul> <li>HTML</li> <li>CSS </li> <li>JavaScript</li> </ul>
	</p>
       
    <p>Back end developers focus on functionality. They do all the behind the scene work like creating libraries and API’s. Back-end  developes usually use these coding languages: <ul>  <li> PHP</li>  <li>Python </li> <li>Java</li>  </ul></p>
